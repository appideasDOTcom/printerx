## printerx is a 3D printer...
That's as beautiful as it is functional. And it's a lot of both.

printerx is a new 3D printer from **os**tmo**xy**

It was originally engineered and designed to resolve several of our frustrations with common 3D printers. Primariy these:
- Issues with stability, accuracy and speed
- The annoying requirement that one spend the first weeks (or months) of owning a new 3D printer, using that printer for nothing other than making upgrades for itself
- The more we get into 3D printing, the more we learn how the machine could have been built better. But it's annoying to tear the printer apart and perform (sometimes expensive) upgrades one at a time. Why didn't my 3D printer manufacturer give me a 24V power supply? 2 amp motors? A 32 bit controller? Silent stepper motor drivers? Bearings that don't need lubrication and are silent? etc. Surely, they're aware that these better options exist?
- Still needing to spend a lot of money after the printer purchase because I don't want to devote a laptop to the new printer, because I don't have bed adhesive, or a spool of filament, or a spatula, or tweezers, or...
- The surprisingly common lack of transparency and/or part availability - even when using "Open Source" products or designs.

During its development, printerx also became our passionate Open Source art project.

printerx is currently in late development stages. We expect product completion in early 2020. ostmoxy will be selling fully-constructed printers. However, we're all ferociously Open Source, so the plans, bill of materials and build instructions will all be available to anyone who wants to build one. Details will be available at [ostmoxy.com](http://ostmoxy.com) (will redirect to [appideas.com](https://appideas.com) until their website content is ready to be made public)

Most of the 3D printed models on printerx were originated by APPideas and/or ostmoxy. A few are taken from other sources that are Open Source and do not have commercial restrictions. Still others are derivatives of Open Source models that are likewise licensed.

Attributions (will) appear where appropriate prior to general product availability. Additionally, ostmoxy is building Open Source contributions into its bill of materials, so every printer sale will provide some compensation to the authors of the Open Source materials that were used.

All materials for printerx created by APPideas and/or ostmoxy are GPLv3. We'll get more official with licensing and attribution as this project reaches completion.
