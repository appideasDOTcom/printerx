This is the third party attribution information for printerx.

### The following Open Source third party models are used:

**costmo Bracket & accessories**

- License: GPLv3
- Source: [github](https://github.com/appideasDOTcom/3dPrinterModels/tree/master/costmo%20Bracket)
- Info: The costmo Bracket and its accesories are the orginal property of APPideas. The costmo Bracket is the most useful accessory we have used for 3D printers and CNC routers. You can read more about it here: [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Mount-nearly-Anything-to-nearly-Any-3D-Printer-or-/) The wire trap has been adapted from its original use as a costmo Bracket accesory to be mounted on a 20-series form (2020, 2040, etc.) and to be mounted to a power supply (PSU) using an M4 bolt.

**Handle for 2020 extrusion** (V-slot handle)

- License: Creative Commons - Attribution
- Source: [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1107453)
- Info: The epitome of a stable 3D printer is having the ability to pick it up - even while it's printing - move it and put it back down without having to recalibrate anything. We wanted to invite frequent moves to demonstrations at buddies' homes, so it was important to us that our printer have a handle. This one from Thingiverse is perfect. It's customizable, comes with source code, and has a nice and open license.

**MCAD library**

- License: LGPL 2.1
- Source: [github](https://github.com/openscad/MCAD)
- Info: An MCAD library from and for OpenSCAD. The gears.scad file has been used in development for its model of 608 bearings, which are stupidly-simple, we just never got around to making our own since one exists. This coe is not used in any production models for printerx.

**Raspberry pi camera mount**

- License: Creative Commons - Attribution
- Source: [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3114849)
- Info: A versatile mount for printerx's Raspberry pi camera. We required no changes from the orginal source. We use the files in the `Printable sets` directory when we build a printerx.
